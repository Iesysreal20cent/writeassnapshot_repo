To choose a product.You need to know what is the benefits,or specs.

Technical spec:(as of v0799 release,which is 1st aniversary build)
Have Reproducible builds(verified tested with two seperate build windows certutil SHA512 compare,also verified once by anon on linux).
Tested on JDK14 as official known lowest min JDK version needed.Pure java.Currently uses modified prebuilt binaries zulu-community from Azul.(once tested by anon with OpenJDK11.)
No mix mash language,(Clean no python sudden fail.The script to compile with the OS wide scripts like bash or batch).
Multi threaded system.Min two thread recommend.One gui,One background cmd.(BTW,your OS spins probably around 8-infinity).
As secure and as efficient as possible within our knowledge and resource,while not making the code extremely hard to be maintained and customized.
User Customization are standardized and have specification and pre release tests.
Can utilize JDK9 modular system,custom jre with jlink.Have official releases with custom jre which are tested.

Technical spec with analogy for normies:
1)THE RELEASE APP IN DEVELOPER COMPUTER IS THE SAME ON YOUR DEVICE.You can RE-build.can check signature.IT SHOULD be the same.Else means modified by SoMe..
It is similar to verifying the parsel.high quality.Official will always have the signature you can check.DEVELOPER also SHOULD INCLUDE TOOLS for users unless.The developer forgets...
2)You can go online download other JDK14 or above binary for your hardware,update some parts and it should work perfectly.IF you know how to replace it properly.Very cool feature..
many company prebuilt JDK.IBM,openJDK,currently uses Zulu ones,because they are consistent and no AOT compile and less many technical flexibility and complexity which could confuse user.Thanks zulu.
3)Analogy.No manual mix auto gear car.No mix solar powered and petrol car.Dont get me wrong.they are generally fine IF AND ONLY IF WELL ENGINNEERED.BUT,I AM SOLO.AS OF NOW...maybe..
4)Multi threaded system.Yes,no worry your devices probably is quad core or whatnot.This only need dual,2 as minimum.you probably have quad,4,so don't worry.
5)As secure and as efficient for most daily user need,the security probably will NOT be national security level.UNLESS the developer had the chance to experience and learn properly.
Even if the Devs learned they also need to implement it which needs time.Also if the community TOTALLY cannot understand then user cannot customize.
Then poses the choice of security or user friendly problem.BUT,DONT WORRY BECAUSE FOR NOW THE DEV ARE TOO POOR to make this a full time job,so learning slowly..
So,as an advice.Do not use this to create over complex plugin or do security critical surfing.Instead use tor browser or whatnot which are specifically built to go the chaotic internet.
Places like gemini capsules instead is probably ok.
6)It guarentees that it won't need you to update your customization UNLESS DEVELOPER have statement.probably is a VERY BIG NEWS.
As example,your grandma,grandpa can just download copy paste delete and it will works the same.FOR ALMOST ALL OF THE TIME.AMAZING.
The UI,the style,the commands is all the same.Nothing will change for user.UNLESS have announce BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY IS BROKEN(DEV will probably give very damn good reason to do so).
7)Have official releases of Minimal CUSTOM ENGINE.Hope analogy makes sense.It is tuned SPECIFICALLY to make sure the base works,small,fast,stable,secure.
But,some of your custom bloated plugin may NOT work and it is EXPECTED.Just like a CUSTOM made car MAY NOT have 6 seat or air cond.IT SHOULD MAKE SENSE,IT IS NOT A BUG.

User choice table(left or right)
Dev,stable	:Development release is not very stable and may not work perfectly,while stable can just setup and use it should just works.
ori jdk,custom jre:all plugin should work in ori jdk.while the other may have plugin problem,NOTE java.base contain java.net.So there NO guarentee for bad networking code in plugins.
Have src,no src:Do you understand java programming language.Do you want to check or change how it works.If both yes.Get the src.Else no need.

Common Quick preset.
1.reproducibility guarentee(Yes,No) on stable release:If Yes,Get the Release with JDK,or other jdk IF know how to setup JDK and compile,NOTE MUST HAVE source.
1.Minimal stable release:official customjre,no source,Stable release.

Known product.
There are two release
Bi-Monthly releases,Development releases.
(custom jre or full jdk is up to user choice.Will be given both)
NOTE,DEVELOPMENT RELEASE MAY CRASH.INCONSTRUCTIVE COMPLAINS ABOUT DEVELOPMENT RELEASES WILL TREATED the same as null.

1st time buyer.
No src,just binaries.1Pound
Have src and binaries.2Pound
subsequent purchase.
No src,just binaries.0.75 pound
Have src and binaries.1.5 pound
(Have source will include the tools to reproduce build)

EVERYTHING IS DOCUMENTED EVEN HAVE A EQUATION,No arguements.OK?

Used Exchange rate for 2021.
1XMR,monero=150Pound
thus,1Pound=0.00666... approx=0.0066
THAT IS USED AS UNIT,NO DEBATES NEEDED.I DO NOT HAVE THE TIME to read AND BARGAIN.BUSY learning.
