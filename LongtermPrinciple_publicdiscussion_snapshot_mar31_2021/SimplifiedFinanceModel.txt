Created with JavE.

It should be quite fair.The core is very stable.The Aim and Principal should be very strong.

You may be curious it does not seems to just state power model,not financial model.

The reason is simple.
Just change the software contribution to financial contrbution it is also almost the same.

The changes are just reversing the arrows in core.

Then what qualify as a core devs to receive that?
Very simple ,there are only two case.Contribution or formal contract based.
As usual to be fair.Anyone that has helped improve the product more will receive more.
Contract based,is just like most jobs that are in the world,as of 2021.still exist and used.

That it for now,written as of 1st ani release.
