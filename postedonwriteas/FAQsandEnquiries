COMMON FAQ,
Q1,hey isn't Patreon crowdfunding.

A1,no it isn't.a quote from patreon official post,
Patreon is not a crowdfunding platform; it's actually a membership platform. The biggest reason to choose one platform over the other is the kind of business model you want to use. In this section, we'll dive into those business models. Patreon Funding Model: Membership and Ongoing Support.
So yeah,relax.Your subscription is yours.Not grouped or mixed.

Q2,Do I need to buy for each family member to use legally?

A2,No in this case,you PROBABLY DO NOT need to buy this program multiple time.In fact in devs home on multiple devices have this app,Thus Ie(home from japanese romanji) Sys(System).
A small incomplete copy paste from license but should be convey the meaning.
you MAY:c)display, disclose, rent, lease, modify, loan the Software or any part thereof.
So you probably can just legally say you rent to your daugther for free or a few penny.I think is perfectly acceptable in most country.Most judge will probably accept that.

Q3,Bought it.Downloaded it.Unpacked it.Now what do I do.I am confused.

A3,OK.1st,read the userguide.2nd follow the instructions.Setup and run.
However,pls do note the BEST SAFE way is to first run checkproductscript.Download the official hash and signature verify both of them then unpack.
If you get the source then simply re-build with Javac.verify the inner hash.Then use it.Customize it.
If have any problem can contact me.If curious what we created for open source community then check out our github or codeberg.

Q4,security bug found!Some info leaked!Emergency

A4,Contact us(Check contact section).But,it may take 1 or two week.we do not open mails often.Yeah.. need to think of a way to be responsive.

Q5,I DO NOT know How to customize.But I saw others very beautiful.HELP ME.

A5,sorry no.If you saw it next time.Just ask for the source,trade with them,We cannot help you much because We do not have any clue where to start.
Eg wallpaper,Where to get it.We DO NOT track any user customization.IS IT homemade font?Where to get it?Is it sellable?We DO NOT KNOW.
UNLESS IT IS OFFICIAL RELEASED BY us OR someone share to us and they are very generous license it CC or something.
THIS ANSWER WILL BE TRUE AS LONG AS WE DID NOT HOST AND STORE user personalization setting.

Q6,Erm,..Sorry...My older xx configuration broke after new releases.I checked the specifications.I see it is the same version.Can you fix it.

A6,Yes.But if possible sent us a copy of your personalization file(please REMOVE sensitive info or whatnot).It will accelerate our debug process by idk how many percent.
But,it will help us test and make sure it is fixed perfectly.(AS OF NOW NO PUBLIC BUGTRACKER SYSTEM.Very bad.note.)

Q7,I have a improvements I want to contribute and kinda be a part of project.

A7.Thank you.we will however only accept small patches.Email us the final product.Will compensate you if possible.As of 1st ani,still haven't have a proper private repository to share and work collaboratively.

Q8,I have created a plugin.Can I sell it.Any forced license?Any limitations.

A8.Nice,Yes you can sell it for any value.We DO NOT force license.However,the MIT or GPLv2 is encouraged.
There are only verbal moral limitations.Which is not create a plugin which collect or sells user personal data.
The reason it is a soft limitation is because nothing in this world is absolute and we do not have time nor interest to start more social wars.
